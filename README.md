## Testimonials

> “As someone who worked on the AP Statistics FAQ document, I not only learned how to use Google Sheets and Excel for data analysis, but it also made me realize how fun data analysis can be (at least for me). I was so inspired that I eventually conducted an independent research project involving a lot of data analysis, learnt the R language on my own, and published a sole-authored research paper on it. In addition, during my time helping on AP (not only on the AP Statistics FAQ but also as a helper and review session host), I realized that I loved teaching and tutoring. I branched out to other volunteer tutoring programs, and did so much that I talked about these experiences the most on my college applications and I’m still talking about them to this day! I truly believe that without AP Students and the AP Statistics FAQ that I helped out with, I would not be at where I am right now. That’s why I want to expand this into something much bigger to not only help struggling AP students, but also to hopefully inspire FiveHive volunteers (that’s you!) in pursuing newly founded passions.”
